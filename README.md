This is a simple stroke prediction model based on a clinical historical data on patients in a hospital.

# Skills to be used
1. Importing data and data preprocessing (Load data, data cleaning, data transformation, feature engineering, missing data imputation)
2. Build prediction models including logistic regression, support vector machine, decision trees, random forest, and XGBoost
3. Evaluate and select prediction models based on evaluation metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, recall, F-score, and AUC
4. Deploying the best prediction model using R
